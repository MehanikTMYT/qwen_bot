First, ensure that your project contains only static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) because GitHub Pages supports only static content and does not run server-side technologies like Node.js [[3]].

Here’s how you can proceed:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: If you haven’t already, create a new repository on GitHub where you will host your static website. You can do this by logging into your GitHub account, clicking on the ""+"" icon in the upper right corner, and selecting ""New repository.""

2. **Add Your Static Website Files**: Navigate to your newly created repository. Click on `Add file` > `Upload files`. Drag and drop your static files or choose them manually from your downloaded Replit project folder [[6]].

3. **Configure GitHub Pages for the Repository**: Go to the ""Settings"" tab of your repository on GitHub, scroll down to the ""Pages"" section, and configure it to publish your site from a specific branch, typically `main` or `gh-pages`. Select the appropriate folder (usually `/root` or `/docs`) that contains your static files [[1]].

4. **Access Your Deployed Website**: Once GitHub Pages has finished building your site, you will be able to access it via the provided URL, which usually follows the format: `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>` [[2]].

Since you mentioned that you downloaded your project from Replit, make sure to include only the static files (HTML, CSS, JS) from your project. If your project includes backend code (like Node.js), those parts won't work on GitHub Pages, as it only hosts static sites [[3]]. 

If you still have your project open on Replit and prefer to push directly from there instead of uploading files manually, you can use Replit's version control features. Here’s how:

1. **Open Version Control on Replit**: Open the Replit project that you want to push to GitHub. Click on the ""Version Control"" tab on the left-hand side of the Replit window [[4]].

2. **Connect to GitHub**: Follow the prompts to connect your Replit project to your GitHub account and push your code to a new or existing repository.

Finally, once your static files are in the GitHub repository, continue with enabling GitHub Pages as described earlier to make your website live.",2025-04-05 20:24:42,qwen-max-latest,Qwen2.5-Max,search,"{""source_0"": {""url"": ""https://dev.to/mrdprasad/how-to-host-a-static-html-css-and-javascript-website-on-github-pages-a-step-by-step-guide-3o64"", ""title"": ""How to Deploy a Static Website on GitHub Pages - DEV Community"", ""snippet"": ""1.
